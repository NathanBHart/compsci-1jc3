**Objective:** Generate a library of basic functions for working with vectors represented by 4-tuples. Include the ability to grab values from vectors, scalar multiplication, addition of vectors, finding the inner product of vectors, finding the distance between vectors, and finding which vector in a list is furthest from the origin.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Use synonym types.
- Extract values using pattern matching.
- How to use auxillary functions and local values
- How to use local abstraction to improve code comprehension

**Possible Extensions:**
- Change system so it works on vectors of variable length (e.g. list of double values as opposed of 4-tuples)
