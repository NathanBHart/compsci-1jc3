**Objective:** Introduction to Haskell, use Haskell to work with cubic functions and evaluate any real solutions that may exist using standard formulae.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Become comfortable using Haskell
- Break problems into smaller sub-problems (functional abstraction)
- Learn how to construct a useful testing plan for simple functions.

**Possible Extensions:**
- Allow imaginary solutions
- Set up formalized datatypes to represent cubic systems
