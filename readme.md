# **COMPSI 1JC3** (Introduction to Computational Thinking) Assignments 1-4

## Learning Haskell to practice computational thinking

For my COMPSCI 1JC3 Course at McMaster, we had to complete 4 assignments to demonstrate our knowledge of using the Haskell programming language, as well as our understanding of computational thinking. These 4 assignments (cubed roots, vectors, graphs, and derivative solver) indicate some of my cumulative learning regarding this component of the course.

<p style="padding: 1em; margin: 1em; background-color: rgb(240, 220, 220);"><b>Note:</b> With increasing complexity, the final assignment `Derivative_Solver.hs` is the strongest indicator of my capability using Haskell following the completion of the course.</p>

I have updated a few of these assignments to improve clarity and code structure, but for the most part they are functionally identical to the original assignments I submitted.
