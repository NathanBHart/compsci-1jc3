**Objective:** Generate a library of basic functions for working with a basic custom graph datatype. Include the ability to look up the greatest NodeID found in a graph, the ability to insert a node into a graph, the ability to remove a node from a graph, the ability to lookup a node, and the ability to add a connection (edge) between nodes in a graph.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Learn how to use algebraic datatypes, newtypes, and synonym types.
- Understand graphs as commonly implemented in computer science.
- Understand how graphs can be searched and manipulated using pattern matching and recursion.
- Strengthen competency with Haskell syntax, pattern matching, and notation.

**Possible Extensions:**
- If graphs are gauranteed in sorted order by max NodID, implement binary search.
